# Google Meet - Global Shortcuts

Chrome Extension for adding shortcuts for toggling microphone/camera even when you're in other tabs

## Usage

As this extension is still *beta*, it's not published in Chrome Web Store yet. You can manually load zipped releases downloaded from [Releases](https://github.com/mkobayashime/google-meet-global-shortcuts/releases) page in the Extensions settings (`chrome://extensions`). Please note that you have to enable `Developer mode` there beforehand.
